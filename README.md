Since the API used in this project is being hosted on an insecure server, I have out of necessity, decided to host the project on my own web server.

The server is a digital ocean droplet that I configured with a debian install along with a simple apache2 server that I had previoulsy used for my business site. Using apache virtual hosts and a free domain name from no-ip.com pointed to the server IP address, I can not only host my business site, but also host this project.
