Ok, I think you can do this using a for loop, so you're getting an array 
of json objects, each with a name and url field, so you can iterate over 
it using a for loop:
for (i in monsterData)
then within the for loop you can check if there's an entry matching the 
search term:
if(monsterData[i].name == searchTerm,
and if there is set the result to monsterData[i]
Then once that's done you can check if result exists (ie it's not none, 
it will be if no entries match the search term) then you can set 
monsterURL = result.url
